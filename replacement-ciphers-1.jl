# Replacement ciphers (part 1)

This notebook is about _replacement ciphers_. A replacement cipher is a kind of code where we replace each letter in a message with another. For example, replace every _A_ with an _F_, every _B_ with a _Q_, etc.

(More specifically, we will look at one-to-one replacement ciphers. This means that every letter in the original message has only one target, and every target has only one original.)

In this notebook, we will define such ciphers, and make a start with solving them. Since solving ciphers is pretty hard, we will look at a simpler case: ceasar ciphers. We will see what it takes to write a program that solves these simpler ciphers.

Part 2 of this notebook is about solving replacement ciphers. The two notebooks are intended to provode a gradual introduction into the topic, but you can skip ahead if you're feeling very confident.

No particular programming knowledge is required for the exercises, nor any knowledge about ciphers.

## Defining ciphers

### The alphabet

First, we need to define our alphabet. This is the collection of characters that we we are going to be replacing.

The characters A-Z will be sufficient:

A one-to-one replacement cipher will replace each character in the alphabet with another. We need a _key_ to tell us which character to replace with which.

Here is a function that will make a random key.

## Ceasar ciphers

It's straightforward enough to decrypt a message when you know the key, but the real fun is in decrypting a message where you _don't_ know the key. And by fun, I mean that it's difficult.

We'll start with a simpler version of the puzzle, using the _ceasar cipher_. Ceasar ciphers (also known as shift ciphers) are a kind of replacement cipher where the replacement for each character always has the same distance in the alphabet. For example, _A_ is replaced by _D_, then _B_ is replaced by _E_, _C_ by _F_, and so forth.

Ceasar ciphers are easier to crack because they only have 26 possible keys (in a 26-character alphabet).

md""" 
### Defining the ceasar cipher

We are going to write some more specialised functions that apply our replacement cipher code for ceasar ciphers.

For a ceasar cipher, the _key_ is just the shift number: that is all we need to know to encrypt or decrypt a message.

To use our replacement cipher functions, we need to convert the shift key to a list of replacements:
"""

### A first attempt at cracking the cipher

Now that we can apply a ceasar cipher, how can we crack it? Well, since there are only 26 possibilities, you could just check every single one. Let's try that. Here is a secret message:

This list of solutions only had 26 options, but with a "normal" replacement cipher, there are way too many options to go over them by hand like this.

Instead of letting the computer generate solutions and picking the right one by hand, we should let the computer pick out the best solution too.

To do that, our program will need some way of knowing what English text looks like. That is how you were able to pick out the right message, after all: you didn't know what it was going to say, but you can recognise English text when you see it.
"""

# ╔═╡ 7cc9612a-bbac-4cad-bc5f-3c2bdc71ee90
md"""
### What does English text look like?

There are lots of properties that distinguish real English text from random gibberish. Some of them are more useful than others.

Let's start by thinking about how you are able to recognise a solution as real text. A big part of that is that you will recognise the words.

Sadly, recognising words is a good strategy for _verifying_ a solution, but not for _finding_ one. If we are even a little bit off from the real solution, we won't end up with real English words. With this method, it is very difficult to tell if we are getting close at all. Often, the only way to tell which solution is the right one is to consider every single one.

(Another problem with recognising words is that you need to know a _lot_ of words before it works reliably.)

Instead, we will start by using a very different kind of knowledge: the frequency of different characters. Some characters, like 'E', are very frequent in English text, while others, like 'X', are not frequent at all. So the most frequent character in your encrypted message is more likely to have been an 'E' than 'X'.

Let's start by counting the characters in a message.

Okay, so now we know how to count characters in a text. Those character counts give us a kind of 'profile' of a text. But in order to see if those frequencies look like normal English, we need some kind of reference of what normal English looks like.

## Wrapping up

That's it for this notebook!

To wrap everything up: we introduced _replacement ciphers_. Decrypting a message is difficult if you don't know the _key_, but difficult if you don't. We solved an easier version of the problem by focusing on a more resctricted kind of replacement ciphers, namely _ceasar ciphers_.

Ceasar ciphers are easier to solve because they don't have many keys, which is why you can check every single solution. Our evaluation method was also fairly straightforward: again, it helps that caesar ciphers have very limited options.

The _part 2_ to this notebook will get into the more complex case of solving any replacement cipher.
